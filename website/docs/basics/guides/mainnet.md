title: Run a CKB Node
---

Running a CKB node not only contributes to the robustness and decentralized nature of the network, but also allows you to access data from the blockchain without any third party, which in turn increases your security.

To run a node, you need to use the command line. If you have never used it before, you may refer to [how to use the command line tool](https://www.google.com/search?q=learn+command+line) to get started on your computer. Although it may seem complicated at first, it is quite simple and following the specific instructions below should allow you to easily run a CKB mainnet node.

## Run a CKB Mainnet Node

Step 1: Download the latest CKB binary file from [CKB releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/releases) 

Step 2:  Unzip and extract the downloaded file to an easily accessible folder. We recommend `C:\ckb` for Windows and `~/Documents` for Mac.

Step 3: Open Terminal on Mac or Command Prompt on Windows.

* Mac:

You can open Terminal in two ways: either go to the Applications folder, then open Utilities and double-click on Terminal, or launch Spotlight search by pressing `Command - Spacebar` or `Control -Spacebar`, then type "Terminal" and double-click on the search result. The subsequent steps will be executed in Terminal.

* Windows:

(If you are familiar with command line in Windows, you can skip this step and open `cmd` or `Power Shell` instead.)

Download and install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win), once the installation is complete, open the Command Prompt.

In the Command Prompt window, type the following git command and press Enter:

```
git --version
```
This verify Git commands are available and its current version (--version)

Step 4：Copy and paste the commands below into the Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows):

Note: make sure to edit the commands according to your folder names and directory. 

* Mac

```
cd /Users/(NAME)/Documents/ckb_v0.32.1_x86_64-apple-darwin
./ckb --version
./ckb-cli --version
```

**Note**: If you encounter the error: `“ckb” cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.` You can temporarily [override](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491) your Mac security settings to open it. Go to _System Settings_ and click on _Privacy & Security_.

* Windows

```
cd C:/ckb_v0.32.1_x86_64-pc-windows-msvc 
ckb --version 
ckb-cli --version
```

ckb 0.32.1 (9ebc9ce 2020-05-29)
ckb-cli 0.32.0 (0fc435d 2020-05-22)
```

</details>

Step 5: To run the CKB mainnet node, copy and paste the commands below into Terminal (Mac) / Command Prompt (Windows):

* Initialize the node (run only once)

```
ckb init --chain mainnet
```

## Run a Public RPC Node
CKB nodes have built-in RPC functionality, which becomes available as soon as the node is started.

RPC is private by default. Exposing RPC through the `rpc.listen_address` configuration option allows arbitrary machines to access the JSON-RPC port, posing a security risk. Therefore, it is strongly discouraged. 

However, if you have to expose them, make sure to strictly limit the access to trusted machines only, by following the method below.

### RPC Access Control
Here is an example to use Nginx API Gateway to configure the RPC access control. Explore more solutions or submit new ones using the GitHub tag [ckb-rpc-proxy](https://github.com/topics/ckb-rpc-proxy).

Step 1: Install Docker-Compose and Docker

```jsx
apt install docker-compose
apt install docker
```

Step 2: Clone Code

```jsx
git clone https://github.com/cryptape/ckb-nginx-proxy.git
```

Step 3: Replace Default Value With Your CKB RPC Address

```jsx
cd ckb-nginx-proxy

sed -i "s/YOUR_CKR_RPC_IP:8114/192.168.1.100:8114/" nginx.conf
```

Step 4: Run Proxy

```
docker-compose up -d
```

### Example

Get tip block hash and number:
```
echo '{
    "id": 2,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "get_tip_header",
    "params": []
}' \
| tr -d '\n' \
| curl -H 'content-type: application/json' -d @- \
http://192.168.1.100:80

// Note that http://192.168.1.100:80 needs to be changed to your proxy IP!
```

Result:
```
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result": {
        "compact_target": "0x1d090fbe",
        "dao": "0xba17553fab3db84154bc4aa9f09b2600e826a2b0df99010400ed51b4686b5808",

        "hash": "0x7a46e779a3fc2d5b55c82aad852e721b0097bf873927b9751409b1d185599ce4",

        "timestamp": "0x1847a2bfad2",
        "transactions_root": "0x28157a5962c4ae1d3e153b1d8d331e5fd3c158866287f5398ab7f7d38210dfb0",
        "version": "0x0"
    },
    "id": 2
}
```
Execute `clear_tx_pool`:

```jsx
echo '{
    "id": 2,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "clear_tx_pool",
    "params": []
}' | tr -d '\n' | curl -H 'content-type: application/json' -d @- \
http://192.168.1.100:80
```

Result:
```
